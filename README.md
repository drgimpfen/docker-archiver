## Architecture

### Phased Execution

Each archive run follows a 4-phase process:

1. **Phase 0: Initialization** - Create necessary directories
2. **Phase 1: Stack Processing** - For each stack:
   - Check if running (via Docker API)
   - Stop containers (if configured and running)
   - Create archive (tar/tar.gz/tar.zst/folder)
   - Restart containers (if they were running)
3. **Phase 2: Retention** - Apply GFS retention rules and cleanup old archives
4. **Phase 3: Finalization** - Calculate totals, send notifications, log disk usage

See **How Stack Discovery Works** below for full details on how stack directories are detected and scanned.

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone and Configure

```bash
git clone https://github.com/drgimpfen/Docker-Archiver.git
cd Docker-Archiver
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and set:
- `DB_PASSWORD` - PostgreSQL password (required)
- `SECRET_KEY` - Flask session secret (required)
- `SMTP_*` - Email/SMTP configuration (optional)

### 2. Start Services

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

The application will be available at **http://localhost:8080**

> **Recommended update workflow (pull & restart app service)**
>
> On development/test VMs it's convenient to use a compact, robust one-liner that pulls the repo, updates images, rebuilds the `app` service and tails recent logs:
>
> ```bash
> git pull --ff-only && sudo docker compose pull && sudo docker compose up -d --build --no-deps --remove-orphans app && sudo docker compose logs -f --tail=200 app
> ```
>
> **Note:** `--ff-only` prevents accidental merge commits; `--no-deps` + service target (`app`) limits disruption to other services.

> **Note:** Stack directories must be configured in `docker-compose.yml` as volume mounts (see below).

### 3. Initial Setup

On first visit, you'll be prompted to create an admin account.

### 4. Configure Archives

1. Go to **Archives** → **Create Archive**
2. Select stacks to backup
3. Configure schedule (cron expression)
4. Set retention policy (GFS: days/weeks/months/years)
5. Choose output format
6. Save and run manually or wait for schedule

## Stack Directory Configuration

**Easy Setup:** Just add your stack directory mounts to `docker-compose.yml` - the application will automatically detect them!

### Automatic Detection (Recommended)

Docker Archiver auto-detects stack directories from bind mounts that are mounted into the archiver container. Detection is performed using (in order): `docker inspect` on the running container, and `/proc/self/mountinfo` as a robust fallback.

Key behavior:
- Only **bind mounts** are considered. Named Docker volumes are ignored.
- The scanner checks the **mount root** and **one level of subdirectories** (fixed behavior; this is not configurable).
- Hidden directories (starting with `.`) and special names like `archives` or `tmp` are excluded.
- Results are **deduplicated** by resolved path.
- Each discovered stack is annotated as **direct** (compose found at mount root) or **nested** (compose found in a subdirectory).
- If no mounts are detected the legacy `/local` path is scanned as a final fallback.

### Volume Mounts (how to configure)

Add bind mounts for your stack directories in `docker-compose.yml`. Examples:

```yaml
services:
  app:
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
      - ./archives:/archives
      - /opt/stacks:/opt/stacks
      - /srv/docker/stacks:/srv/docker/stacks
      - /home/user/docker:/home/user/docker
```

```yaml
services:
  app:
    volumes:
      # Docker socket (required for container management)
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
      
      # Archive output directory (adjust path as needed)
      - ./archives:/archives
      
      # Stack directories - ADD YOUR MOUNTS HERE:
      - /opt/stacks:/opt/stacks
      - /srv/docker/stacks:/srv/docker/stacks
      - /home/user/docker:/home/user/docker
```

### How Stack Discovery Works

Discovery follows these rules:
- The app first **auto-detects** candidate mount points from bind mounts inside the archiver container.
- For each mount point the app checks the **mount root** and **one level of subdirectories** for compose files:
  - If a compose file is present at the mount root, the stack is marked as **direct**.
  - If a compose file is present in a subdirectory, the stack is marked as **nested** (the subdirectory becomes the stack path).
- The scanner **ignores** hidden directories (names that start with `.`) and obvious non-stack names like `archives` or `tmp` to reduce false positives.
- Results are deduplicated by resolved path so the same stack mounted multiple ways is only listed once.

**Behavior for non-mounted stacks:** If a stack directory is not available via a bind mount, the archiver will use the path as it appears inside the container (the container-side path) when running compose commands; it will not attempt to use host-only paths that are not mounted into the container.

**Fallback & compatibility**: If no bind mounts are detected the legacy `/local` path will be scanned to maintain compatibility with older deployments.

**Important:** Host and container paths must match for bind mounts (e.g. `- /opt/stacks:/opt/stacks`). The archiver uses the container-side path it detects as the working directory for `docker compose` commands.

### ⚠️ Important: Bind Mounts Required

**Stack directories MUST use bind mounts** (not named volumes):

✅ **Correct:**
```yaml
services:
  app:
    volumes:
      - /opt/stacks:/opt/stacks  # Bind mount (host:container - same path)
```

❌ **Incorrect:**
```yaml
- my-volume:/opt/stacks    # Named volume - will NOT work
```

**How it works:** Docker Archiver uses the configured `STACKS_DIR` paths directly. When it finds a stack at `/opt/stacks/immich`, it uses `/opt/stacks/immich` as the working directory for `docker compose` commands (since host and container paths are identical).

**How it works:** Docker Archiver automatically detects the host path by reading `/proc/self/mountinfo`. When it sees `/local/stacks/immich` inside the container, it looks up the corresponding host path (e.g., `/opt/stacks/immich`) and uses that for `docker compose --project-directory`.

**Note:** Named volumes *within* your stack's compose.yml (like `postgres_data:`) work perfectly fine - this requirement only applies to mounting the stack directories into the archiver container.

### Bind mounts — recommended configuration

For reliable discovery and correct `docker compose` execution, the host path and container path of your stack directory bind mounts should be identical (for example: `- /opt/stacks:/opt/stacks`).

Why this matters:

- Docker Archiver runs `docker compose` commands inside the container and expects to find the stack's compose files at the same path it discovered. If the host and container paths differ, the app tries to infer the host path from mounts, but this can lead to ambiguities or failures when running `docker compose` (e.g., when the host path is not accessible inside the container).
- Using identical paths avoids edge cases and ensures that archive and docker-compose commands run from the correct working directory.

**Bind-mount mismatch detection:** The archiver will now detect bind-mount mismatches (host path != container path). When mismatches are detected, the dashboard shows a prominent warning and those mounts may be ignored for discovery; if an archive job resolves to no valid stacks because of ignored mounts, the job will abort early and be marked as failed with a clear log message ("No valid stacks found"). To avoid this, prefer identical host:container bind mounts.

Examples:

- Recommended: `- /opt/stacks:/opt/stacks` (host and container paths match)
- Not recommended: `- /home/stacks:/opt/stacks` or `- /opt/stacks:/local/stacks` (host and container paths differ)

For more details and troubleshooting tips, see the dashboard warning messages or open an issue in the project repository.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Required | Description |
|----------|---------|----------|-------------|
| `TZ` | Europe/Berlin | No | Timezone for the application (e.g., America/New_York, Asia/Tokyo) |
| `DB_PASSWORD` | changeme123 | Yes | PostgreSQL password |
| `SECRET_KEY` | (dev key) | Yes | Flask session secret (change in production!) |
| `SMTP_SERVER` | - | No | SMTP server for email notifications (e.g., smtp.gmail.com) |
| `SMTP_PORT` | 587 | No | SMTP port |
| `SMTP_USER` | - | No | SMTP username |
| `SMTP_PASSWORD` | - | No | SMTP password/app-password |
| `SMTP_FROM` | - | No | Email sender address |

> **Note:** Port (8080) and mount paths are configured in `docker-compose.yml`, not via environment variables.

### Retention Policy

**GFS (Grandfather-Father-Son)**:
- **Keep Days**: Daily archives for last X days
- **Keep Weeks**: One archive per week for last X weeks
- **Keep Months**: One archive per month for last X months
- **Keep Years**: One archive per year for last X years

**One Per Day Mode**: When enabled, keeps only the newest archive per day (useful for test runs).

### Cron Expressions

Format: `minute hour day month day_of_week`

Examples:
- `0 3 * * *` - Daily at 3:00 AM
- `0 2 * * 0` - Weekly on Sunday at 2:00 AM
- `0 4 1 * *` - Monthly on 1st at 4:00 AM
- `*/30 * * * *` - Every 30 minutes

## Notifications

Docker Archiver uses [Apprise](https://github.com/caronc/apprise) for notifications.

### Supported Services

- Discord
- Telegram
- Email (SMTP)
- Slack
- Pushover
- Gotify
- And [100+ more](https://github.com/caronc/apprise#supported-notifications)

### Setup

**Option 1: Apprise URLs (Recommended)**
1. Go to **Settings** → **Notifications**
2. Add Apprise URLs (one per line):
   ```
   discord://webhook_id/webhook_token
   telegram://bot_token/chat_id
   ```
   **Note:** `mailto://` URLs are not allowed. Use SMTP environment variables for email notifications.
3. Select which events to notify:
   - Archive Success
   - Archive Error
   - Retention Cleanup
   - Cleanup Task
4. Optional: Add subject tag prefix (e.g., `[Production]`, `[TEST]`)
5. Optional: Toggle between HTML and Plain Text format
6. Test your configuration with the "Send Test Notification" button
7. Save settings

**Notification options**

- **Report verbosity** — Choose between **Full** (default) and **Short** reports. Full includes the detailed HTML report with tables and (optionally) the full job log; Short sends a concise summary suitable for chat notifications.
- **Attach full job log** — When enabled, the full job log will be attached as a downloadable `.log` file instead of inlining it in the email. Useful for very large logs or when you prefer attachments.
- **Attach log on failures only** — If enabled, the log will only be attached when the job had failures (overrides attaching-on-success behavior). These settings are configurable on the Notifications settings page and default to `Full` verbosity with no attachment.

**Option 2: SMTP/Email (Automatic)**
1. Configure SMTP in `.env` file (see Environment Variables above)
2. Add email address in **Profile** page
3. All users with configured email addresses automatically receive notifications

**Important:** Do not use both SMTP environment variables AND Apprise `mailto://` URLs for the same email address, as this will result in duplicate notifications. Use SMTP environment variables for email, and Apprise for other services (Discord, Telegram, etc.).

## API Documentation

### External API (for automation/integrations)

All external API endpoints are located under `/api/*` and support **Bearer token authentication**.

#### Authentication

Generate an API token in your user profile (coming soon) or use session-based authentication from the web UI.

**Header Format:**
```
Authorization: Bearer <your-api-token>
```

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"stack_name":"mystack","archive_path":"/archives/path"}' \
  http://your-server:8080/api/jobs/123/download

# Download archive (no auth needed)
curl -O http://your-server:8080/download/abc123token
```

### Web UI Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|

| `/settings/` | GET/POST | Settings page |
| `/health` | GET | Health check |

### Reverse Proxy Configuration (Pangolin, Authelia, etc.)

When using an authentication proxy like Pangolin or Authelia, you need to **exclude** the following paths from authentication:

```yaml
# Paths that should bypass authentication
exclude_paths:
  - /download/*         # Archive downloads (token-based, 24h expiry)
  - /api/*              # External API endpoints (use Bearer token auth)
  - /health             # Health check endpoint
  - /login              # Login page must be accessible
  - /setup              # Initial setup page
```

**Note:** The `/api/*` endpoints have their own authentication via Bearer tokens. The download endpoint (`/download/<token>`) uses time-limited tokens and doesn't require session authentication.
